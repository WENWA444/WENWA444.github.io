# 🧪 CTFs & Lab Challenges

These hands-on labs showcase my ability to apply concepts in practical scenarios — from penetration testing to network defense.

## 🔍 TryHackMe: Simple CTF
- **Challenge:** Break into a basic web server and gain root access.
- **Approach:**
  - Enumerated hidden directories using `gobuster`
  - Discovered weak SSH credentials
  - Escalated privileges using a kernel exploit via `LinPEAS`
- **Tools Used:** gobuster, Hydra, LinPEAS, netcat
- **Key Takeaway:** Strengthened understanding of web exploitation and Linux privilege escalation.

## 🛡️ CyberShujaa Lab: Network Defense Basics
- **Challenge:** Detect and block attacks in a simulated enterprise network.
- **Approach:**
  - Captured packets in Wireshark to identify malicious behavior
  - Hardened firewall settings using `iptables` and `fail2ban`
- **Tools Used:** Wireshark, iptables, Fail2Ban, Linux
- **Key Takeaway:** Gained hands-on practice in monitoring and host-based intrusion prevention.
